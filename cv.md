## **About myself**:

My goal is to change the scope of my work, change my life.

I'm very purposeful. I achieve almost any goal I set for myself and do it efficiently. I know how to enjoy the work done. In addition, I have good soft skills and easily approach people

I have experience as an economist but I want more. I want to become part of a big team in IT-company and make a cool product. This really inspires me. I have good soft skills and I easily find an approach to people

I tried to find myself in testing and graphic design, but I realized that front-end development is what really energizes me. Therefore, I have embarked on this difficult and long path right now, but I believe that I will go through it successfully and with pleasure.
